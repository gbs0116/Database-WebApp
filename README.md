# Pet Adoption Database System

A relational database system designed to manage and streamline pet adoptions. This project focuses on structuring and querying pet adoption data, including pets, owners, breeds, adoptions, and locations, to improve efficiency for adoption agencies.

## Features
- **Database Schema Design:** Developed a relational database using ER/EER modeling to define entities and relationships.
- **SQL Query Implementation:** Includes SQL scripts for:
  - Creating tables and constraints (`dbDDL.sql`).
  - Inserting, updating, and deleting records (`dbDML.sql`).
  - Querying adoption trends and available pets by breed/location (`dbSQL.sql`).
  - Dropping tables and cleaning up the database (`dbDROP.sql`).
- **Basic Web Interface (Flask + HTML, Minimal Interaction):**  
  - A simple interface to view database records using `app.py` and `index.html`.  
  - Not a full-featured web applicationâ€”primarily for demonstrating database queries.

## Technologies Used
- SQL (DDL, DML, Aggregation, Joins)
- Python (Flask for minimal web integration)
- ER/EER Modeling
